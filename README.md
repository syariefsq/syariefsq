# 👋 Hi, I’m Syarief Qayum Suaib

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a data enthusiast with a unique blend of commercial and technical experience—from managing global FMCG brands to building robust data solutions. My journey is all about connecting business needs with the power of analytics and machine learning.



## 🚀 My Story & Motivation

- After years in Marketing & Account Management for brands like L’Oreal and Kraft Heinz, I realized how much business success depends on data-driven decisions.
- I made a bold switch: diving deep into Python, machine learning, and cloud tools to bridge the gap between business and tech.
- I thrive on solving real-world problems—whether that means optimizing sales, predicting outcomes, or automating workflows.
